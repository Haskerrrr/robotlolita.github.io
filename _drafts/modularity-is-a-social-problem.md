title:  Modularity Is A Social Problem
snip:   How is modularity a social problem, and how Harmonia lessens it

Modularity is one of the big problems we, language designers, try to solve in
programming languages.  There is this beautiful ideal where you would write
programs by just putting small pieces together and things would Just
Work™. Sadly, reality is a lot more harsh, and modularity and composition are
neither simple, nor easy, and things get worse as you stray from the trivial
use cases.

Even Haskell, a language that's praised for its modular and compositional
approach still has plenty of pain points around the corners (whenever effects
are involved), and in its module construct.  Things get worse as you consider
modularity in a larger, social context, which packages and package managers
were supposed to fix, but never got anywhere close to that. Package management
and modularity is a hard problem, and it is a hard problem because it's largely
a **social** problem. It's about people and interactions, just as it is about
technology.

There is some research that acknowledges such problems, and proposes solutions
to them. In this article I'll walk you through how I'm lessening these problems
in my new programming language: Harmonia.  Stick with me!
