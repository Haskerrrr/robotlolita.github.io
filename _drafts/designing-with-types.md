When designing an API, we are obviously looking to give our users something that will be a joy to use, and easy to understand, but we also have other concerns to care about, such as guaranteeing that the library does what it should do, and that it is fast enough for the things it should be used for. To achieve correctness and security, our library must impose constraints on which operations are valid, and which are not (so that, for example, an user that is not logged in can not update the status for any user; or an user with an empty shopping cart can't proceed to the payment screen). To make our libraries fast, in a language like JavaScript, our best bet is to make our code predictable, which helps JITs analysing and optimising our code by not needing as many guards, branching, and worse of all, deoptimising the code it had already optimised!

Turns out we can easily achieve all of these goals by applying the type theoretical reasoning to designing our libraries. It should come at no surprise that types would help to enforce constraints, after all, that's all types are for: they're there to prove that your program is correct. But doesn't types make things unnecessarily complex and unflexible? How would types help with making things simpler, and easier to use? Well, this is a common misconception about types, usually arising from experiences with fairly limited type systems (e.g.: Java, C, C#, C++, etc.). The concepts underlying types are a great aid for the library designer, specially to achieve simplicity and easy of use â€” and in the case of JavaScript, which is an untyped language, it happens to be something they'll help more than achieving correctness in itself.

In this article I'm going to show some of the reasoning about optimising programs for JIT'ing JavaScript VMs, programming for correctness (which incurrs in fewer bugs), separation of concerns, and simplifying APIs for ease of use. Everything backed up with the concepts from type theory.

## 1. Introduction

Most JavaScript programmers who have to work with the DOM end up, sooner or later, falling in love with jQuery. Not exactly because it is a great library, but it does get the job done, has lots of extensions, and keeps out of your way... until it doesn't. While the library can easily fill in the simple cases, it quickly becomes unwieldy for more complex situations, where you would hope to abstract some of the problems away in order to keep the maintainability of your code base at a sane level. There are also performance problems once you start demanding more from the library, and you end up having to perform some fairly dirty tricks to keep things fast enough.

But it doesn't have to be this way. Would we be able to redesign jQuery so that it's fast, easy to use, scales to cover the complex cases in a maintainable way, and still manages to be performant? By providing insights on the design of libraries for JIT'ing VMs, and people, this article tries to provide an answer to that question.

An objective analysis of jQuery is in order to present its problems (Section 2) and the values the library has (Section 3). With this analysis, we separe the concerns of the library in orthogonal concepts (Section 4), which will aid both the simplicity, ease of use, and the managing of complexity, by providing common combinators to bring different concepts together (Section 5).

For analysing performance (Section 6), we start with a high level description of the general process of JIT optimisations, the common analysis performed and the transformations applied based on such analysis, and conjecture that type predictability is a good starting point for pursuing better performance optimisations from the JIT compiler.

And before concluding, we present higher-order programming and common abstractions facilities in functional programming as a way to add flexibility to our library (Section 7), and provide evidences that the final piece matches the properties we are interested in (Section 8).


## 2. An objective analysis of jQuery's problems

jQuery poses itself as a DOM abstraction library, although it does much more than this. It provides primitives for interacting with asynchronous I/O over the HTTP protocol, it's own (non-standard) implementation of promises, a fallback CSS selector engine, primitives for visually animated effects, a fallback implementation of event handling with support for delegated events, a way to associate arbitrary data with DOM elements, and a whole lot of utilities that are hardly related to each other (String predicates, collection transformation, type checking, partial application, etc.)
