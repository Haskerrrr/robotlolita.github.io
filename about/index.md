<div class="headline">
<p>I'm an open-minded freedom evangelist, only not as <strong>HARDCORE</strong>
as Richard Stallman.</p>

<p>Occasionally I dabble on programming, language design, functional languages,
teaching, Node.js, designing, fashioning, trolling, and other "ing"s.</p>
</div>


I'm a **front-end developer** and **minimalist designer** based in Belo
Horizonte/Brazil. Most people know me on the great interwebs as Sorella [\[1\]](#fn-1).

My passions include the design and implementation of programming languages and
promoting The Open Web — but I also have interests in interactive storytelling,
psychology, neuroscience, steampunk, fashion, and lots of other crazy stuff.

I started dwelling in programming back when I was 12, since then I've touched a
crazy amount of languages, from ancient ones like (Visual) Basic, to mainstream
ones like Java, Python and JavaScript, to "weird" ones like Clojure, Io and
Haskell, to really esoteric ones like Brainfuck and Burlesque.

Right now I'm employed full-time, and work on side-projects for The Great Good™
of the open-source community, specially JavaScript. In fact, one of my pet
projects is to write
[an entire distributed operating system in JavaScript][orpheos].
